## Cookbook Projects

_This repository contains a variety of projects that are in early stages of development._

_Most, but not all projects, relate to the Three.js 3D WebGL/JavaScript library._

_Every project web page view includes a self-starting demo._

_Several projects have moved up in the world and are now in repositories elsewhere. 
These projects are noted as being deprecated below._

_Projects here are often currently broken. 
This usually means that that there has been an update to Three.js but the project has not yet been updated._
